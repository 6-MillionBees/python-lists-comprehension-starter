## Python: List Comprehension

### Objective

Learn how to use **list comprehension**, a shortcut and newer way to generate a new Python list

### Overview 
- List comprehension lets you fill your new list with values that Python has manipulated or modified for you in some way
- For example, you could take a list of numbers 1 - 10 and tell Python to multiply each number in the list by 100
- Using list comprehension, you can add the result of each calculation to a NEW list, which you could then print or modify further, if desired

### Coding Tasks

#### Title Case Names

- Take a list of 5 - 6 last names and use list comprehension to make a new list of names all in title case


#### Filtered Lowercase Names 

- In your **original list** (`students`), you should have 5 - 7 first names, all written in UPPERCASE
- Use list comprehension to create a new list of student names in lowercase
- Add an `if` statement to your list comprehension that checks the length of EACH student name; if the length of the name is GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 4 characters, Python should include the name in the new list of lowercase names
- Finally, print the new list of lowercase names
- See the `list_comprehension_demo1.py` file for examples of how to get started with list comprehension
